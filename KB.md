## Operator Profile

**Background:** Franck — digital marketer, domain investor, solopreneur based in Paris.

**Domain portfolio context:**
- 68+ domain transactions generating $130,425 from $5,615 invested
- Strengths: .ai domains (pre-boom), .fr rapid flips, expired domains held 2–4 years
- Style: acquires at low cost, identifies category-defining potential, builds or sells

**Active businesses:**
- Templatery.com — one-page website templates, $6K+ revenue, grown from $3K acquisition
- ilovecatalonia.com — travel guide, AdSense + affiliate model, recently launched
- Technical services — website setup, landing pages, automation (WordPress, Carrd, Kit, Zapier)

**Build philosophy:**
- MVP first — live in days, not months
- Preferred stack for content sites: Astro + Cloudflare Pages (see travel guide playbook)
- Preferred stack for tools/SaaS: depends on complexity — Carrd for landing pages, custom for real tools
- Monetization: never single-model, always build in 2–3 revenue streams from day one
- Traction test: 3 months → if no signal, pivot or park

**What he's done that works:**
- Category-defining domain + thin but high-quality content → SEO traffic → affiliate/ads
- Tool concept + waitlist → validate before building
- Domain flips with outreach campaigns (cold email, personalized, prospect-focused)

## Analysis Framework — Detailed

### Market Fit Signals (what makes a domain worth building on)

**Strong signals:**
- Domain is the generic name for a real category (DomainAnalyzer.com, MovingPianos.com)
- Search intent is clear and commercial
- People already pay for solutions in this space
- Domain has brand potential beyond just SEO

**Weak signals:**
- Domain requires explanation
- Market exists but domain is tangential to it
- Incumbent owns the obvious domain already

### Market Size — How to Assess

Search volume proxy (Ahrefs/SEMrush estimates via web):
- Under 1K/mo = micro → hard unless hyper-monetizable
- 1K–10K/mo = niche → viable with right monetization
- 10K–100K/mo = solid → build
- 100K+/mo = large → competitive, need strong angle

Spending proxy:
- Is there paid advertising in this space? (Google Ads CPC > $2 = real market)
- Are there SaaS products charging $20+/mo?
- Are there affiliate programs paying $50+/conversion?

### Competitive Gap Analysis

**What to look for:**
- Top 3 SERP results: are they weak (DA < 40, thin content, old)?
- Is there a dominant SaaS player charging too much?
- Is the UX of existing tools terrible?
- Is there a free tier missing from paid tools?
- Is the content landscape generic/AI-slop?

**Gap types:**
- Price gap — incumbents charge too much, room for a freemium challenger
- Content gap — existing content is thin, generic, or SEO-spam
- Feature gap — tools exist but miss obvious features users want
- Audience gap — market exists but underserved segment ignored
- Trust gap — no independent/editorial voice, just vendor marketing

### Monetization Models — Ranked by Fit

For each domain, evaluate all four and rank:

**SaaS / subscription**
- Best for: tools people use repeatedly (analyzers, trackers, generators)
- Revenue potential: high ($10–$99/mo per user)
- Build time: medium–high
- Risk: churn, support overhead

**Ads + affiliate**
- Best for: content sites with informational search intent
- Revenue potential: medium ($1–$50 RPM)
- Build time: low (content + SEO)
- Risk: algorithm dependency

**Lead gen / marketplace**
- Best for: service businesses, B2B, high-ticket transactions
- Revenue potential: very high per lead ($50–$500/lead)
- Build time: low–medium (landing page + form + outreach)
- Risk: lead quality, sales cycle

**Digital products / info**
- Best for: education, templates, guides, tools in downloadable form
- Revenue potential: medium ($9–$299 per product)
- Build time: low (create once, sell repeatedly)
- Risk: piracy, market education

### MVP Blueprint Framework

Every MVP evaluation answers:
1. What is the single core value proposition?
2. What's the minimum to prove traction? (landing page? free tool? content?)
3. What does week 1 look like? Week 4? Month 3?
4. What's the first revenue dollar path?
5. What's the exit if it doesn't work? (sell domain, pivot, park)

### What's Already Working — Research Protocol

For every domain analysis, search for:
1. "[domain keyword] tool" / "[domain keyword] software" — find SaaS incumbents
2. "[domain keyword] affiliate program" — find monetizable angles
3. "[domain keyword] site:reddit.com" — find real user complaints and needs
4. "[domain keyword] alternatives" — find dissatisfied customers
5. Top 3 ranking pages for primary keyword — assess content quality and DA

## Reference Analyses

### DomainAnalyzer.com — Quick Take
Category: domain tools / SEO tools
Obvious models: SaaS (freemium domain analysis tool), ads+affiliate (domain registrar affiliate = $5–15/domain)
Incumbents: Moz, Ahrefs, SEMrush (all expensive), EstiBot (domain valuation), GoDaddy Appraisals (terrible UX)
Gap: free, fast, independent domain analysis with actionable scores — not vendor-biased
MVP: single-page free domain analyzer (DA, backlinks, traffic estimate, age, monetization potential score)
Watch: Ahrefs/Moz offer free tiers — differentiate on domain-investment-specific scoring

### MovingPianos.com — Quick Take
Category: specialty moving / piano moving services
Obvious models: lead gen (piano movers pay $50–200/qualified lead), affiliate (moving companies)
Incumbents: generic moving directories (Angi, Thumbtack, HomeAdvisor) — none piano-specific
Gap: piano moving is highly specialized, movers actively seek leads, no dedicated marketplace exists
MVP: landing page + lead form → sell leads to local piano movers, charge per lead or monthly listing
Watch: local SEO dependency, need coverage across multiple cities to scale

### PlanCruncher.com — Quick Take
Category: planning tools / business planning / financial planning
Obvious models: SaaS (business plan generator/analyzer), digital products (templates), ads
Incumbents: LivePlan ($20/mo), Bizplan, Enloop — all full business plan builders
Gap: "cruncher" implies quick analysis, not full plans — lean business plan / financial snapshot tool
MVP: free one-page business plan generator or financial ratio cruncher
Watch: "plan" is ambiguous — nail down the exact use case before building
